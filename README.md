# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project performs an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data. The data is sourced from a CSV file (`covid_19_clean_complete.csv`), which contains information about the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across different countries and regions. The analysis includes calculating the number of new cases, recovery rates, case fatality rates (CFR), and identifying trends over time.

## Project Objectives

* **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and convert date columns to datetime format.
* **Aggregated Summary**: Summarize data by country/region, calculating confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
* **Time-based Analysis**: Track daily changes in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.
* **Key Metrics**: Calculate the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Recovery Rate.
* **Identifying Trends**: Find the day with the maximum number of new confirmed cases.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Pandas library

You can install the necessary Python library by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Code Explanation

### Step 1: Load and Preprocess Data

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("covid_19_clean_complete.csv")
print(df.head())
print(df.info())
```

This loads the COVID-19 dataset from the provided CSV file. We then print the first few rows and the data summary to understand its structure.

### Step 2: Date Handling and Missing Data

```python
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
df.fillna(0, inplace=True)
```

We convert the 'Date' column to a datetime format and fill any missing values with zeros.

### Step 3: Country-Level Aggregated Summary

```python
country_summary = df.groupby('Country/Region')[['Confirmed', 'Deaths', 'Recovered']].sum()
country_summary = country_summary.sort_values(by='Confirmed', ascending=False)
print(country_summary.head(10))
```

This step aggregates the data by country/region and sums up the confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. The summary is sorted by the number of confirmed cases in descending order.

### Step 4: Sorting and Calculating New Cases

```python
df_sorted = df.sort_values(['Country/Region', 'Date'])
df_sorted['NewCases'] = df_sorted.groupby('Country/Region')['Confirmed'].diff().fillna(0)
```

We sort the dataset by country and date, and then calculate the new cases for each country as the difference between consecutive days.

### Step 5: Latest Data and Metrics Calculation

```python
df_latest = df[df['Date'] == df['Date'].max()]
df_latest_grouped = df_latest.groupby('Country/Region')[['Confirmed', 'Deaths', 'Recovered']].sum()
df_latest_grouped['CFR'] = (df_latest_grouped['Deaths'] / df_latest_grouped['Confirmed']) * 100
df_latest_grouped['RecoveryRate'] = (df_latest_grouped['Recovered'] / df_latest_grouped['Confirmed']) * 100
print(df_latest_grouped.sort_values(by='CFR', ascending=False).head(10))
```

We filter the dataset to include only the most recent date and group the data by country/region. We then calculate the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and the Recovery Rate for each country/region.

### Step 6: Identifying Countries with Zero Deaths

```python
zero_deaths = df_latest_grouped[df_latest_grouped['Deaths'] == 0]
print(zero_deaths)
```

This step identifies countries/regions that have reported zero deaths.

### Step 7: Daily Global Summary and Maximum New Cases

```python
daily_global = df.groupby('Date')[['Confirmed', 'Deaths', 'Recovered']].sum().reset_index()
daily_global['NewConfirmed'] = daily_global['Confirmed'].diff().fillna(0)
max_day = daily_global.loc[daily_global['NewConfirmed'].idxmax()]
print("Date with max new cases:\n", max_day)
```

We summarize the global data on a daily basis and calculate the new confirmed cases. The date with the maximum new confirmed cases is then identified.

## Results

* The top 10 countries/regions with the highest confirmed COVID-19 cases are displayed.
* The top 10 countries/regions with the highest Case Fatality Rate (CFR) are shown.
* Countries/regions with zero reported deaths are identified.
* The day with the highest number of new confirmed cases is printed.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into COVID-19 trends, including case fatality rates, recovery rates, and the global spread of the virus over time. The analysis can be extended by incorporating additional metrics, visualizations, or incorporating data from more recent sources.
